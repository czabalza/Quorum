q1 = Question.create(title: "How long do you count before throwing a grenade?",
 description: "")
 a1 = Answer.create(body: "You DON'T count before throwing a grenade.
 You count AFTER throwing it.

 I'll explain.

 Having pulled the pin out, the grenade still does not go off.
 If you are holding it correctly, the trigger - that's the long \"handle\" to the side of the grenade, hasn't been released yet.
 Once you throw the grenade the trigger gets loose, and a 3 second delay is available till the detonation occurs.

 That's why there is no point counting before.
 Counting afterwards is meant to give the thrower's teammates an indication on time to explosion.

 Helps prevent your ear drums from tearing open if not protected, and ensure no one runs into the area that's about to be covered with debris before it does.

 Now, sure, I too have seen the Hollywood heroes who let the trigger go, count till the last second and then throw. (Notice the actors usually hold the trigger because they have no idea what they're doing...)

 Anyway - if I had such a \"hero\" in my team, I'd throw him along with the grenade.

   Explosives are not toys.
   You don't play with them.")
a2 = Answer.create(body: "Most grenades have a 4-8 second fuse (US standard is 4-5.5 second), but there's some variation in the delay of the powder train.  With some Russian grenades, users were given a box of various delay fuses, including 0, 5, and 13 second variations -- the 0 second fuses were for tripwire detonation traps.  Hilarity ensued when people mixed up the fuses.

The generally accepted technique is to pull pin and throw immediately.  In some cases, this is not desirable because the enemy can observe the grenade being readied, and may be able to throw it back.   Due to the variability of the grenade fuses (sometimes less than 3 seconds!), \"cooking off\" grenades is not something you should really do.  The USMC publication MCWP 3-35 describes it as the \"least preferred technique\", although it is something documented as an option.  The purpose is to deny the enemy the ability to throw back or kick away the grenade before it detonates.  The same thing can be achieved by throwing the grenade at high speed or in an erratic pattern (like bouncing it off something).  The bouncing technique can be trained with live grenades; the cooking off (for 1-2 seconds) can only be used in actual combat, not in training.

  Fragmentation grenades in general are \"defensive grenades\"; they are thrown from cover or other protected positions, or into holes or structures.  The US models have a lethal radius of 5m, casualty radius of 15m, but can produce injury at a great radius, so they aren't thrown in front of advancing troops.")

If I want a glass of clean, healthy water I only need to walk as far as my kitchen faucet. All the water I can drink faster than I can drink it. It's so cheap that I never have to worry that I'm drinking too much.

If I want to eat fresh produce I just need to open my fridge. If there's none there, there's always, always, always more within a few miles. I don't even have to walk very far - I have my very own car that I can get in and drive to the store.

If I look carefully I can probably find enough dropped change in the parking lot to pay for one serving of produce. Money and food are both that abundant here. But I don't. Because I've never had to worry about tracking my pennies and dimes closely enough to buy an orange.

If I'm bored I've got this electronic box where all I have to do is push a few buttons and boom! all the cat videos I want. It's kind of embarrassing, but I actually keep one of these boxes in my purse. Mostly it's for information and entertainment but it also allows me to talk to people, no matter how far away they are.

  There are free libraries all around town. My neighborhood has a free swimming pool and a free park! For less than one full day of minimum wage work I can go to a museum or a zoo or an aquarium or a musical or take a painting class.

  If I'm hungry and don't want to cook for myself there are places all over town ready to cook for me. My toughest choice is which continent I want my dishes to be inspired by. These meals cost me roughly two to three hours of minimum wage work (and there's often enough food that I can take home enough for a second meal!) I sit down and it's all brought to me. People actually come up to me regularly and ask if I'd like more water. It's like I'm a queen or something.

  In many parts of the world $2/day is a respectable income. $2 in the US is a stingy tip on one of those meals.

  If I'm in a hurry and not concerned with nutrition, then I can have someone give me food while I sit in my car! For less than one hour of minimum wage work!

Now how could I possibly have improved on that?")

a5 = Answer.create(body: "Here's the actual answer to the question:

There's an inverse correlation between contentedness and drive.

Here's some background:

When you make enough money to live a comfortable life, it's not worth the risk or time exchange or both for some to \"change the world\" in the sense that you mean.

Most people are content with the status quo. That's human nature. That's how societies work and become successful. There's a shared set of goals and values and if you've achieved those in your society, a sense of belonging and pride tend to ensue.  Contentedness follows.

What about those that want to take it to another (not better or worse, just different) level? What are they faced with? Possibly risking all the time and relationships they've invested. I won't even get into the amount of thinking, planning, creating, organizing, and hustling it takes for the average person to change levels. Some people don't even know where to start and that takes the game from risky to impossible (if only in their own minds). Why wouldn't they be content to just continue in the society where they're successful enough?

That's why most people will not ever take this risk. The risk itself is scary. They're content. They can support their family quite well without much ado. AND THAT'S OKAY. We need those people. We need the stability because it allows those of us who want to take risks the luxury of being able to do so.

There will still be a grocery store, a bank, a hospital, public utilities, schools, and factories.  Most innovators, game changers, and people who are impacting the world rely on these services to become successful.

So in a sense, those who are content working the 9-6 jobs do change the world. You need the basic services they provide to move forward with your own ideas even if you're going to start a juice stand and need produce from the market, who gets it from the farmer, who uses water from a well someone had to dig, not to mention the people who had to harvest the fruit and transport it.

  Just imagine the amount of 9-6 people Apple needs to make the phone you're going to do most of your business on.

  This is how societies work:

  Insofar as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap.

  If you're not content with the status quo, then it's more likely that you'll be driven to take the financial and social risks to move to another level. That's something to celebrate, commend, and encourage.

  But who's going to work for you?")

a7 = Answer.create(body: "The story of a ship in World War II that disguised itself as an island.  After a crushing defeat at the hands of the Japanese at the Battle of the Java Sea, the Dutch Navy was left with just four warships in the Dutch East Indies.  Realizing that staying around was a recipe for disaster, the ships decided they would try and escape to Australia.  However, odds for escape weren't high, as the area was crawling with Japanese warships and planes.  In a matter of days, all but one ship was sunk.

The only Dutch warship to survive was the minesweeper Abraham Crijnssen.  This ship had no guns, and was extremely slow, so the crew recognized that making a straight run for Australia would mean getting spotted (and then sunk) by the Japanese.  So, they came up with an idea: they would cut down a bunch of trees and set them up on the deck of the ship and paint vertical surfaces to look like rock cliffs, so that the ship looked like an island.  So as not to draw suspicion, the ship would only move after dark, and would anchor during daylight hours close to shore so that it would just look like another island.  Since there are over 17,000 islands in Indonesia, one lone moving island was easy for the Japanese to miss.
By moving just a little bit each night, the Abraham Crijnssen evaded detection by the Japanese.  It took them eight days to reach Australia, after which the ship fought with the Allies until the end of the war.")

a8 = Answer.create(body: "Making people believe that eating carrot improves eye sight. And my mom, still keeps telling this (carrots are good for eyes, but has no correlation with improved eye sight).

During World war II, there were couple of developments in Britain:

1. Britain imported about 70% of its food items from elsewhere, while it had an abundance of carrot grown domestically. A food shortage due to naval blockade was imminent. But how to encourage people to eat carrot?

2. Britain's RAF during the war, had developed a superior radar so that now they could work even in dark, but the invention was kept under wraps for obvious reasons. RAF were then reeling with the problem of sudden surge in identification and hit rates of German aircrafts, especially during night time. Also Britain with help from Poles had cracked the enigma (the encryption device that Germans felt were unbreakable) and reading almost all their communications and hence were aware of every single German fleet movement. They even had to restrain themself from bringing down few targets even when they perfectly knew where they were. So how to take advantage of these 2 technology breakthroughs without causing suspicion among Germans?

They decided to kill these 2 birds with one stone - Through a massive propaganda that carrot improves eye sight during black outs. This while encouraging people to eat carrot, also explained the improved hit rate.

a9 = Answer.create(body: "During WWII, the British convinced the German commanders that they had found top secret documents that explained the Allied plan to invade Sardinia and Greece.  This allowed the Allies to invade their real target, Sicily, while German troops awaited invasions in Sardinia and Greece that never came.

They did this by first obtaining a corpse of a homeless man in London who had died by ingesting rat poison. (It was unclear if it was a suicide or an accident, but the cause of death would be hard to differentiate from hypothermia/drowning).  They then gave him a false identity as a Major in the Royal Marines, dressed him as such, and attached a briefcase to his belt with a chain through his sleeve (similar to the handcuffed briefcases used by jewel deliveries).  The briefcase contained the false identity papers and details of the false invasion plans.  Then they put a life jacket on the corpse, and threw it out of a submarine near the Spanish coast, where they knew he would eventually wash up on shore.

Spain was officially neutral, but was known to cooperate with Germany, and when a fisherman found the body, it was taken to Spanish officials, who provided the documents to German officials.  The British even sent requests to their ambassadors in Spain to be on alert because a plane crashed near the Spanish coast carrying important documents that they should attempt to retrieve at all costs.  The fake major's fake name was included in the London Times' death notices, just in case the Germans checked.

  Hitler bought it, and German troops were moved from Sicily, France, and the Eastern Front to Sardinia and Greece to await the invasion.  Even after the invasion of Sicily began, Hitler was still convinced that it was a trick, and that Sardinia and Greece were the true targets.  The Germans did not move troops to defend Sicily until it was too late.  The Allies now had Sicily conquered, which was then used as a base to eventually advance through Italy.

  Later in the war, when German officials found genuine secret documents with war plan details, they were often disregarded as similar deception attempts.  Plans for the D-Day invasion at Normandy that were found by the Germans were ignored by Hitler, who believed them to be falsely planted documents, and he continued to incorrectly believe that the invasion of France would come into Calais.")

q1 = Question.create(title: "What are the signs of an ultra smart person playing dumb?", description: "")
a12 = Answer.create(body: "The brief flash of amusement in response to a quip or allusion that most people wouldn't understand.  Even someone with a decent poker face has a hard time suppressing the smile/laugh/eye crinkle response to something funny and unexpected.

Humor by definition has an element of surprise and our reaction to it is quick.  It takes much longer to analyze the level of the joke and decide, \"Should I laugh?  Was that a joke anyone would get or one only a really smart person would get?\"

Vocabulary is another clue.  If you vary your vocabulary level and you get delayed incomprehension, it's probably fake.  Try inserting a bogus word into a conversation sometime where the context gives no clue as to the meaning.  People's faces immediately get a blank look as they try to process it and wait for some clue to the meaning in what comes after it.

If, instead of a fake, it's an arcane term only someone with a large vocabulary would know, it will take quite a bit of extra time for a person who does know the word to process the content and do the meta-analysis to realize, \"Oh, wait, I\'m not supposed to know what that word means.  I'd better pretend I don't know it.\"

Wm Homer pointed out another one:  the person who doesn\'t argue with a self-proclaimed authority, but instead apologetically asks a 'naive' question that is perfectly designed to expose the fallacy in the logic or the faulty premise behind the argument.
And, as Josh Manson pointed out, simply not falling into common traps can be a big clue.

a15 = Answer.create(body: "If you don't know what a realistic salary is for this position, then by all means avoid being the first to put a number on the table. That's negotiation 101.

Consider: if you mention a number that's too low, they will talk you down a bit (of course) and then accept your figure and you'll leave money on the table. But if you shoot too high, they might think you have an unrealistic opinion of yourself ("NOT a team player!") or assume you really are that good and therefore out of their price range. Either way, you risk receiving no counter offer at all.

The goal is to get a conversation going that includes specific numbers, without taking either risk mentioned above. To do that, you want them to establish the bottom end of the range by putting the first number on the table so you can negotiate up from there.

  There are many techniques to get them to name the figure first. The one you use will depend on the specific circumstances.

  For example, are you new to the area? If so, use that fact by saying, \"I\'m unsure what a position like this would normally pay in this town, so any figure I mentioned would be a shot in the dark. What range did you have in mind?\"

  Or if you know their competitors also have open positions, you could say, \"The salary range I\'m seeing among your competitors is pretty broad, and I really want to fit in with your situation here. What were you thinking?\"

  There\'s the frank approach, \"I don\'t know what this job is worth to you, but I do know I really want to work here, so what would it take for me to fit in without breaking the bank?\"

    You can also name a non-number, for example, \"I\'m not sure what this position is worth to you, but I'm certainly not going to ask for $XXX.\" Make that number extremely high, but not so high that they immediately realize you know it's altogether unrealistic. The number will get into their head, and it will frame the rest of the conversation, and they'll feel relief later if you name another figure that is lower.

    So, lots of ways to avoid putting a serious number on the table first...use your imagination and tailor it to the actual circumstances.

    If they're bad negotiators, this is all it will take to get them to name a figure. Of course, they\'ll name one at the low end of their range, so you should counteroffer significantly higher (usually 10% to 20%) while showing plenty of enthusiasm about their company and the position.

    If they\'re good negotiators, they\'ll push back in some way to get you to name the figure. Try at least one more time to put it back on them. (\"Seriously, I have NO idea what this position pays in this town, so I\'d really appreciate it if you'd just fill me in.\")

    Often at this point an understanding begins to develop, with both of you tacitly realizing what the other one is doing. If so, that will mean they'll view you as a good negotiator, a very highly valued business skill in any industry, which means one more check mark on the \"hire\" column beside your name. So even if you do end up naming a number first, you will have garnered some respect.

    And if you do end up having to name a figure first, THEN you name something very high (just a little below the \"non-number\" mentioned above if you used that approach, or else pick the highest number you can reasonably imagine getting paid for the position, and add about 20%). Suggest that figure with a smile (to let them know you realize it might be a tad outrageous) and say something like, \"Since you\'re insisting that I take a shot in the dark here...how about $XXX?.\" They might laugh, or frown, and try to get you to suggest another number without countering, but at that point you should dig in your heels and insist on a counter offer. (\"Really? You think $XXX is too much? Hmm... What did you have in mind?\") Make it clear that you feel you complied with their request, and they\'ll probably go ahead and name a figure. Then the real discussion can begin.

2) There is a surplus of homes that need to be sold and huge stretches of the nation with depressed economies.

The money, knowing that my resume would be more or less set for life, the high-profile company - all of that usual stuff sounds great. It certainly influences my desire, I won't deny that. But none of that matters quite as much to me.

The biggest thing for me is validation. If I had to describe my personality in three words, I'd use \"stubborn\", \"extreme\", and \"insecure\". I've got to be one of the most insecure people that I know. On top of that, I'm no genius. Far from it, probably. I'm not one of those people who's been programming since before he could walk. My parents never worked at IBM (they're not even engineers at all). I've never even seen an Altair.

q1 = Question.create(title: "What are the best kept secrets of great programmers?", description: "")
a18 = Answer.create(body: "1. Never reveal all that you know.


OK, seriously this time.  I think there are really a few things that distinguish great programmers.
Know the concepts.  Solving a problem via memory or pattern recognition is much faster than solving it by reason alone.  If you\'ve solved a similar problem before, you\'ll be able to recall that solution intuitively.  Failing that, if you at least keep up with current research and projects related to your own you\'ll have a much better idea where to turn for inspiration.  Solving a problem \"automatically\" might seem like magic to others, but it\'s really an application of \"practice practice practice\" as Miguel Paraz suggests.
Know the tools.  This is not an end in itself, but a way to maintain \"flow\" while programming.  Every time you have to think about how to make your editor or version-control system or debugger do what you want, it bumps you out of your higher-level thought process.  These \"micro-interruptions\" are small, but they add up quickly.  People who learn their tools, practice using their tools, and automate things that the tools can\'t do by themselves can easily be several times as productive as those who do none of those things.
  Manage time.  Again it comes back to flow.  If you want to write code, write code.  If you want to review a bunch of patches, review a bunch of patches.  If you want to brainstorm on new algorithms . . . you get the idea.  Don\'t try to do all three together, and certainly don\'t interrupt yourself with email or IRC or Twitter or Quora.  ;)  Get your mind set to do one thing, then do that thing for a good block of time before you switch to doing something else.
    Prioritize.  This is the area where I constantly see people fail.  Every problem worth tackling has many facets.  Often, solving one part of the problem will make solving the others easier.  Therefore, getting the order right really matters.  I\'m afraid there\'s no simple answer for how to recognize that order, but as you gain more experience within a problem domain - practice again - you\'ll develop a set of heuristics that will guide you.
    Reuse everything.  Reuse ideas.  Reuse code.  Every time you turn a new problem into a problem you already know how to solve - and computing is full of such opportunities - you can save time.  Don\'t worry if the transformed solution isn\'t absolutely perfect for the current problem.  You can refine later if you really need to, and most often you\'ll find that you\'re better off moving on to the next problem.
    A lot of these really come down to efficiency.  As you move through more problems per day, you\'ll gain more experience per day, which will let you move through more problems per day, and so on.  It\'s a feedback loop; once you get on its good side, your effectiveness (and value) will increase drastically.")

q1 = Question.create(title: "What are some things foreignors believe about the United States but Americans know are laughably way off?", description: "")
a21 = Answer.create(body: "I had a strange encounter with some guys while I was in Laos (the country between Thailand and Vietnam) and with Chinese nationals in Yunnan who thought similarly.
- Pretty much everyone has white skin, or are as pale as possible.
This simply stems from the Bai, Li, and Hmong affinity for pale skin as a sign of obvious wealth and luxury. America is the wealthiest country on earth, thus everyone must take pains to look wealthy by keeping their skin white. It was very hard to explain tanning to them.
- Everyone is filthy rich and the doctor son of a doctor.
Stories will trickle back from relatives who moved a long time ago, mostly the perception of the suburbs and how clean they are and the cars that everyone drives. Also, Modern Family and Big Bang Theory somehow made their way there, confirming any suspicions. Inevitably, America becomes a swarming sea of suburbia for all the doctors and lawyers and businessmen that make up our population, nobody has to farm or work, and everything is pretty awesome for those who make it. Unfortunately, this leads to the next one.
- Americans don't know how to do work.
I suppose this is true for a number of teenagers and children these days, not to mention young adults, some baby boomers... well, truthfully a lot of people can't lift a hammer. The explanations of how to use a digging hoe were extensive, and if we were slow, we'd need to be shown a demonstration. Blisters earned you some laughs from callus-handed kids.
- We largely don't kill animals.
This surprised me, since we obviously do, but the explanation turns out to come from NGOs and other servicemen, who would often be vegetarian or express a refusal to kill or harm living livestock for food. Girls in my group told a man not to kill a snake, and he gave them a quizzical look before pounding it to smithereens with a shovel. In rural areas, the Americans they saw were very much not in the mood to see blood.
  - The \"hamburger\" is the primary source of sustenance for Americans.
  Not having access to ham, or not aware that it's actually the relatively rare meat \"beef,\" most restaurants would serve Laotian hamburgers made completely vegetarian (see above) with two pieces of toast, cabbage, onion, and a slice of tomato. I also saw this in Dali Prefecture, China. They usually managed to get fries right though.
  - Anything that starts with \"American\" is state-run.
  This was always a problem for some reason. For instance, I go to American University and shop at American Eagle. After nodding and some weird responses, turns out the impression was that I was a state worker and that my clothes were made by government companies.
  - America is black and white.
  In Laos, they were surprised by my friend who is Korean-American. They repeatedly attempted to speak Chinese to him, and when we explained we only spoke English, they couldn't believe that he was from Illinois. In China, they weren't as unaware, but they did have an insulting word for him.
  - We're all very religious.
  Both of our guides in Laos and China told me that they were always surprised by how much we gave tribute to shrines. I always bow to the Buddha before entering a temple out of respect, and after a while my guide asked \"So, you are very Buddhist?\" He then told me that a lot of tourists did the same and he found it strange, since many of his friends were atheist or Christian.
  - The alcohol age is much lower.
  Like, 10 years lower.
  - Justin Bieber is American.
  This is just an insult.")
a22 = Answer.create(body: "That Americans don't like foreigners.  I can think of nothing further than the truth.  In fact, annoyingly, Americans love when people come here, it almost inflates our \"everybody wants to come here\" ego.  There are racist parts of the country that don't want \"non-whites\", but really, despite those people (who -- frankly -- exist everywhere), Americans love people from around the world (despite the fact that we have no clue where you're from and couldn't ever find it on a map).")

a23 = Answer.create(body: "I'm a member of a happy couple. My wife and I...

Keep separate bank accounts. When we share an expense, like the rent, we both contribute. Some people are astounded (even offended) that we do this, but in 18 years of being together, we've yet to have a single fight over money.
  Play together. We play traditional games, like chess, but more often we talk in silly voices, use socks as puppets, etc. We have a pantheon of characters that \"live with us.\"
  Keep in touch throughout the day. While at work, every couple of hours, we check in via email, phone or IM.
  Spend a lot of our alone time together. We both love sitting on the sofa, doing our own thing. My wife may watch TV while I post answers on Quora, or she may do a crossword puzzle while I read. It's nice to be in the same room together without any expectation that one of us has to amuse the other.
    Work on projects together. We run a theatre company, in which she acts and I direct. So our major hobby time is spent together, building stuff together. We do the same with home improvements, cooking, etc.
      Plan surprised treats for each other. Part of me is always thinking about presents I can get her, experiences I can surprise her with, practical jokes I can play on her, etc. She thinks the same way about me.
      Allow each other to talk about anything. Neither of us is easily offended. She can say anything to me that she wouldn't normally say in public, and I can do the same with her. I completely trust that she's a good person and she feels the same way about me, so we can even vent really ugly stuff around each other, and neither of us judges the other based on it.")
q1 = Question.create(title: "What are some of the best moments of humanity?", description: "")
a24 = Answer.create(body: "There was this British game show called the Golden Balls. The final round of this game was called Split or Steal. The rules of the game were:

After five balls have been won, the contestants make one last decision to determine the final jackpot division. Each contestant chooses one of two final golden balls, one with \"Split\" printed on the cash background inside it, and one with \"Steal\" printed on the killer background inside it.
If both contestants choose a Split ball, the jackpot is split equally between them and they both go home with half the money they've won.
If one contestant chooses a Split ball and the other chooses a Steal ball, the Stealer goes home with all the money and the Splitter goes home empty-handed.
If both contestants choose Steal balls, they both go home empty-handed.

Enter Nick Corrigan. This man had a brilliant idea that would ensure that he would win. He is the guy on the right. Now the players have a chance to speak with each other face to face before making their choices. People would make promises about choosing split and renege and choose steal often resulting in neither player winning the amount. His opponent was Ibrahim Hussein. Nick promises he would steal and split the money with Ibrahim if he chose split. Everyone was flabbergasted by Nick's strategy. Ibrahim tried to convince him to choose split. Ibrahim even gave him his word that he would choose split, and to emphasize what keeping his word meant to him, told him a story about how his father had told him that a man who did not keep his word was not a man. The audience booed him, Ibrahim called him names, but Nick did not budge. After 45 minutes of conversation Ibrahim finally gave up and agreed to choose split because he knew it was going to be a lost cause anyway and hoping that Nick would keep his word after he won the money. Then they were asked to show the ball they had chosen and as expected Ibrahim has chosen split, but Nick had chosen split too. Everybody was shocked. Both of them won half the prize amount.

This is where the story ends in the video. Radiolab did an episode on the same where they discussed with the participants about what had happened[1]. Turns out Ibrahim never wanted to split the money. He wanted to pick steal and take the entire amount for himself. The story about his father was a fake one. He had never met his father. He was brought up by his mother. The line that he spoke was stolen from a film. He did not want to be a sucker, so he would have picked steal irrespective of what the other person said. Nick manipulated this guy to be good. Now the wonderful thing about Nick is that he runs a not for profit organization and all his winnings went into that. So he was actually not playing for himself as much as playing for a charity and in the process he restored our faith in humanity.

q1 = Question.create(title: "Is my LinkedIn profile with my picture in a suit and tie hindering my chances of finding jobs at startups?", description: "I would love to work with mid-size agile tech companies or startups. And I believe I fit much better in such a company. Also, I do have right experience.

But my Linkedin profile has my picture with suit and tie. Wondering if that will send the wrong messages or create a perception that I am more fit for big corporations. And startups and mid-size places will avoid my profile.")
a25 = Answer.create(body: "This won't be a popular answer, but if you are talking about technology startups in Silicon Valley, then the answer is yes, you probably are hurting your chances.
Silicon Valley has a peculiar and yet virulent bias against the suit.  It's even a euphemism for an overly-conservative, corporate-buzzword-speaking, pointy-haired-Dilbert-boss.  No one wants to work with an \"empty suit\".  Software engineers help strongly define the culture in Silicon Valley, and they overwhelmingly don't wear suits, or in general they don't want to work with people who do.

There are exceptions (Siebel was a notable example of a culture that emphasized the suit).  But you will even find a large companies, unless you are interviewing for a position in sales & finance, that you will hurt your chances in a suit.

For younger people looking for jobs in small to mid-size hyper-growth companies a suit has also come to imply a lack of prioritization.  You spend too much time on your clothing, which will not impact business success, and too much time on appearances.

Startups are notoriously contrarian cultures, they are looking to change the status quo.  Dressing in a suit represents the status quo, or at least, a caricature of it.  (This, of course, leads to an ironic conformity in how people at startups dress.)

There is also a strong signal of lack of confidence wearing a suit.  The implication is that you wear a suit because your skills are not strong enough on their own to justify your employment.  You might find that engineers, in general, are proud of the fact that their skills are so valuable that they can find gainful employment where they don't have to wear a costume.  A suit reminds people of what young high school or college students might do to appear grown up.

Probably the most damning thing about the suit in this context, however, is the appearance of being tone deaf or difficult.  You know (as does everyone) that no one wears a suit at a tech startup.  But you wore one anyway.  Either you don't realize that this isn't acceptable, or you are some form of suit-activist.  Neither sounds that appealing in a new hire.

If it isn't obvious from my tone above, I am not justifying this rationale.

However, for your LinkedIn profile, if you are looking for a job at a hyper-growth startup in Silicon Valley, I recommend business casual dress for men & women.")

a34 = Answer.create(body: "To inspire a three year old to behave at the office, give him a job to do. Ask him if he will help you with your work.

Before he comes, prepare in advance. Here are some projects for him:
Ask him to sort paper clips by size.
Ask him to sort a pile of coins -- put pennies in a bowl or jar, nickels in another jar, ditto dimes and quarters.
Sit him at a desk and ask him to edit a page of 12-14 point text by circling each lower case 'a' he sees with the pencil you give him. Then ask him to do the same thing with a red pencil for the letter 'e'. You may have to explain and draw an example of each letter for his reference.
  Whenever he gets bored, give him another job. Let him experience on his own the discovery that work is useful and interesting.
  Explain how it helps you when the clips are sorted, the coins are useful in parking meters, and knowing the lower case letters will help him learn to read, and that helps both of you.
    Find a problem he can solve. Talk it through if needed, but let him solve it. You can do this by talking aloud about a decision you are making. Turn to him and ask: should I respond to this email now? What should I say? Talk it through with him.
      Proudly introduce him to anyone who walks by to say hi -- "This is my son Jay, who came to help me with some work today. Jay, this is Clarence, our Founder and CEO. That means he started this company and is the one who is responsible to keep the company in good shape."

      This way he will feel proud and valued, a contributor and a useful worker. And he will gain an understanding of work and all kinds of good things are imprinted in his mind.

      Get photos taken so he will see himself helping you at work even when he was little. Frame a photo. Put it in your office so it is there whenever he visits. His first real job is to learn what you are like at work.  Capture his moment of discovery if you can work it into his workday, and yours.")
