#  description: "")
#  a1 = Answer.create(body: "You DON\'T count before throwing a grenade.
#  You count AFTER throwing it.
#
#  I\'ll explain.
#
#  Having pulled the pin out, the grenade still does not go off.
#  If you are holding it correctly, the trigger - that\'s the long \"handle\" to the side of the grenade, hasn\'t been released yet.
#  Once you throw the grenade the trigger gets loose, and a 3 second delay is available till the detonation occurs.
#
#  That\'s why there is no point counting before.
#  Counting afterwards is meant to give the thrower\'s teammates an indication on time to explosion.
#
#  Helps prevent your ear drums from tearing open if not protected, and ensure no one runs into the area that\'s about to be covered with debris before it does.
#
#  Now, sure, I too have seen the Hollywood heroes who let the trigger go, count till the last second and then throw. (Notice the actors usually hold the trigger because they have no idea what they\'re doing...)
#
#  Anyway - if I had such a \"hero\" in my team, I\'d throw him along with the grenade.
#
#    Explosives are not toys.
#    You don't play with them.")
# a2 = Answer.create(body: "Most grenades have a 4-8 second fuse (US standard is 4-5.5 second), but there\'s some variation in the delay of the powder train.  With some Russian grenades, users were given a box of various delay fuses, including 0, 5, and 13 second variations -- the 0 second fuses were for tripwire detonation traps.  Hilarity ensued when people mixed up the fuses.
#
# The generally accepted technique is to pull pin and throw immediately.  In some cases, this is not desirable because the enemy can observe the grenade being readied, and may be able to throw it back.   Due to the variability of the grenade fuses (sometimes less than 3 seconds!), \"cooking off\" grenades is not something you should really do.  The USMC publication MCWP 3-35 describes it as the \"least preferred technique\", although it is something documented as an option.  The purpose is to deny the enemy the ability to throw back or kick away the grenade before it detonates.  The same thing can be achieved by throwing the grenade at high speed or in an erratic pattern (like bouncing it off something).  The bouncing technique can be trained with live grenades; the cooking off (for 1-2 seconds) can only be used in actual combat, not in training.
#
#   Fragmentation grenades in general are \"defensive grenades\"; they are thrown from cover or other protected positions, or into holes or structures.  The US models have a lethal radius of 5m, casualty radius of 15m, but can produce injury at a great radius, so they aren't thrown in front of advancing troops.")

# I\'ve had the same wife for 50 years.  Our health is very good.
# Now how could I possibly have improved on that?")
#
# a5 = Answer.create(body: "Here\'s the actual answer to the question:
#
# There\'s an inverse correlation between contentedness and drive.
#
# Here\'s some background:
#
# When you make enough money to live a comfortable life, it\'s not worth the risk or time exchange or both for some to \"change the world\" in the sense that you mean.
#
# Most people are content with the status quo. That\'s human nature. That\'s how societies work and become successful. There\'s a shared set of goals and values and if you\'ve achieved those in your society, a sense of belonging and pride tend to ensue.  Contentedness follows.
#
# What about those that want to take it to another (not better or worse, just different) level? What are they faced with? Possibly risking all the time and relationships they\'ve invested. I won\'t even get into the amount of thinking, planning, creating, organizing, and hustling it takes for the average person to change levels. Some people don\'t even know where to start and that takes the game from risky to impossible (if only in their own minds). Why wouldn\'t they be content to just continue in the society where they\'re successful enough?
#
# That\'s why most people will not ever take this risk. The risk itself is scary. They\'re content. They can support their family quite well without much ado. AND THAT\'S OKAY. We need those people. We need the stability because it allows those of us who want to take risks the luxury of being able to do so.
#
# There will still be a grocery store, a bank, a hospital, public utilities, schools, and factories.  Most innovators, game changers, and people who are impacting the world rely on these services to become successful.
#
# So in a sense, those who are content working the 9-6 jobs do change the world. You need the basic services they provide to move forward with your own ideas even if you\'re going to start a juice stand and need produce from the market, who gets it from the farmer, who uses water from a well someone had to dig, not to mention the people who had to harvest the fruit and transport it.
#
#   Just imagine the amount of 9-6 people Apple needs to make the phone you're going to do most of your business on.
#
#   This is how societies work:
#
#   Insofar as it is collaborative, a society can enable its members to benefit in ways that would not otherwise be possible on an individual basis; both individual and social (common) benefits can thus be distinguished, or in many cases found to overlap.
#
#   If you\'re not content with the status quo, then it\'s more likely that you\'ll be driven to take the financial and social risks to move to another level. That\'s something to celebrate, commend, and encourage.

# a7 = Answer.create(body: "The story of a ship in World War II that disguised itself as an island.  After a crushing defeat at the hands of the Japanese at the Battle of the Java Sea, the Dutch Navy was left with just four warships in the Dutch East Indies.  Realizing that staying around was a recipe for disaster, the ships decided they would try and escape to Australia.  However, odds for escape weren't high, as the area was crawling with Japanese warships and planes.  In a matter of days, all but one ship was sunk.
#
# The only Dutch warship to survive was the minesweeper Abraham Crijnssen.  This ship had no guns, and was extremely slow, so the crew recognized that making a straight run for Australia would mean getting spotted (and then sunk) by the Japanese.  So, they came up with an idea: they would cut down a bunch of trees and set them up on the deck of the ship and paint vertical surfaces to look like rock cliffs, so that the ship looked like an island.  So as not to draw suspicion, the ship would only move after dark, and would anchor during daylight hours close to shore so that it would just look like another island.  Since there are over 17,000 islands in Indonesia, one lone moving island was easy for the Japanese to miss.
# By moving just a little bit each night, the Abraham Crijnssen evaded detection by the Japanese.  It took them eight days to reach Australia, after which the ship fought with the Allies until the end of the war.")

# During World war II, there were couple of developments in Britain:
#
# 1. Britain imported about 70% of its food items from elsewhere, while it had an abundance of carrot grown domestically. A food shortage due to naval blockade was imminent. But how to encourage people to eat carrot?
#
# 2. Britain's RAF during the war, had developed a superior radar so that now they could work even in dark, but the invention was kept under wraps for obvious reasons. RAF were then reeling with the problem of sudden surge in identification and hit rates of German aircrafts, especially during night time. Also Britain with help from Poles had cracked the enigma (the encryption device that Germans felt were unbreakable) and reading almost all their communications and hence were aware of every single German fleet movement. They even had to restrain themself from bringing down few targets even when they perfectly knew where they were. So how to take advantage of these 2 technology breakthroughs without causing suspicion among Germans?
#
# They decided to kill these 2 birds with one stone - Through a massive propaganda that carrot improves eye sight during black outs. This while encouraging people to eat carrot, also explained the improved hit rate.

# a9 = Answer.create(body: "During WWII, the British convinced the German commanders that they had found top secret documents that explained the Allied plan to invade Sardinia and Greece.  This allowed the Allies to invade their real target, Sicily, while German troops awaited invasions in Sardinia and Greece that never came.
#
# They did this by first obtaining a corpse of a homeless man in London who had died by ingesting rat poison. (It was unclear if it was a suicide or an accident, but the cause of death would be hard to differentiate from hypothermia/drowning).  They then gave him a false identity as a Major in the Royal Marines, dressed him as such, and attached a briefcase to his belt with a chain through his sleeve (similar to the handcuffed briefcases used by jewel deliveries).  The briefcase contained the false identity papers and details of the false invasion plans.  Then they put a life jacket on the corpse, and threw it out of a submarine near the Spanish coast, where they knew he would eventually wash up on shore.
#
# Spain was officially neutral, but was known to cooperate with Germany, and when a fisherman found the body, it was taken to Spanish officials, who provided the documents to German officials.  The British even sent requests to their ambassadors in Spain to be on alert because a plane crashed near the Spanish coast carrying important documents that they should attempt to retrieve at all costs.  The fake major's fake name was included in the London Times' death notices, just in case the Germans checked.
#
#   Hitler bought it, and German troops were moved from Sicily, France, and the Eastern Front to Sardinia and Greece to await the invasion.  Even after the invasion of Sicily began, Hitler was still convinced that it was a trick, and that Sardinia and Greece were the true targets.  The Germans did not move troops to defend Sicily until it was too late.  The Allies now had Sicily conquered, which was then used as a base to eventually advance through Italy.
#
#   Later in the war, when German officials found genuine secret documents with war plan details, they were often disregarded as similar deception attempts.  Plans for the D-Day invasion at Normandy that were found by the Germans were ignored by Hitler, who believed them to be falsely planted documents, and he continued to incorrectly believe that the invasion of France would come into Calais.")

# And then he told me about the most common fort-saving-technique of the times.

# Humor by definition has an element of surprise and our reaction to it is quick.  It takes much longer to analyze the level of the joke and decide, \"Should I laugh?  Was that a joke anyone would get or one only a really smart person would get?\"
#
# Vocabulary is another clue.  If you vary your vocabulary level and you get delayed incomprehension, it's probably fake.  Try inserting a bogus word into a conversation sometime where the context gives no clue as to the meaning.  People's faces immediately get a blank look as they try to process it and wait for some clue to the meaning in what comes after it.
#
# If, instead of a fake, it's an arcane term only someone with a large vocabulary would know, it will take quite a bit of extra time for a person who does know the word to process the content and do the meta-analysis to realize, \"Oh, wait, I\'m not supposed to know what that word means.

#
# a15 = Answer.create(body: "If you don't know what a realistic salary is for this position, then by all means avoid being the first to put a number on the table. That's negotiation 101.
#
# Consider: if you mention a number that's too low, they will talk you down a bit (of course) and then accept your figure and you'll leave money on the table. But if you shoot too high, they might think you have an unrealistic opinion of yourself ("NOT a team player!") or assume you really are that good and therefore out of their price range. Either way, you risk receiving no counter offer at all.
#
# The goal is to get a conversation going that includes specific numbers, without taking either risk mentioned above. To do that, you want them to establish the bottom end of the range by putting the first number on the table so you can negotiate up from there.
#
#   There are many techniques to get them to name the figure first. The one you use will depend on the specific circumstances.
#
#   For example, are you new to the area? If so, use that fact by saying, \"I\'m unsure what a position like this would normally pay in this town, so any figure I mentioned would be a shot in the dark. What range did you have in mind?\"
#
#   Or if you know their competitors also have open positions, you could say, \"The salary range I\'m seeing among your competitors is pretty broad, and I really want to fit in with your situation here. What were you thinking?\"
#
#   There\'s the frank approach, \"I don\'t know what this job is worth to you, but I do know I really want to work here, so what would it take for me to fit in without breaking the bank?\"
#
#     You can also name a non-number, for example, \"I\'m not sure what this position is worth to you, but I'm certainly not going to ask for $XXX.\" Make that number extremely high, but not so high that they immediately realize you know it's altogether unrealistic. The number will get into their head, and it will frame the rest of the conversation, and they'll feel relief later if you name another figure that is lower.
#
#     So, lots of ways to avoid putting a serious number on the table first...use your imagination and tailor it to the actual circumstances.
#
#     If they're bad negotiators, this is all it will take to get them to name a figure. Of course, they\'ll name one at the low end of their range, so you should counteroffer significantly higher (usually 10% to 20%) while showing plenty of enthusiasm about their company and the position.
#
#     If they\'re good negotiators, they\'ll push back in some way to get you to name the figure. Try at least one more time to put it back on them. (\"Seriously, I have NO idea what this position pays in this town, so I\'d really appreciate it if you'd just fill me in.\")
#
#     Often at this point an understanding begins to develop, with both of you tacitly realizing what the other one is doing. If so, that will mean they'll view you as a good negotiator, a very highly valued business skill in any industry, which means one more check mark on the \"hire\" column beside your name. So even if you do end up naming a number first, you will have garnered some respect.
#
#     And if you do end up having to name a figure first, THEN you name something very high (just a little below the \"non-number\" mentioned above if you used that approach, or else pick the highest number you can reasonably imagine getting paid for the position, and add about 20%). Suggest that figure with a smile (to let them know you realize it might be a tad outrageous) and say something like, \"Since you\'re insisting that I take a shot in the dark here...how about $XXX?.\" They might laugh, or frown, and try to get you to suggest another number without countering, but at that point you should dig in your heels and insist on a counter offer. (\"Really? You think $XXX is too much? Hmm... What did you have in mind?\") Make it clear that you feel you complied with their request, and they\'ll probably go ahead and name a figure. Then the real discussion can begin.

Failing that, if you at least keep up with current research and projects related to your own you\'ll have a much better idea where to turn for inspiration.  Solving a problem \"automatically\" might seem like magic to others, but it\'s really an application of \"practice practice practice\" as Miguel Paraz suggests.
# Know the tools.  This is not an end in itself, but a way to maintain \"flow\" while programming.  Every time you have to think about how to make your editor or version-control system or debugger do what you want, it bumps you out of your higher-level thought process.  These \"micro-interruptions\" are small, but they add up quickly.  People who learn their tools, practice using their tools, and automate things that the tools can\'t do by themselves can easily be several times as productive as those who do none of those things.
#   Manage time.  Again it comes back to flow.  If you want to write code, write code.  If you want to review a bunch of patches, review a bunch of patches.  If you want to brainstorm on new algorithms . . . you get the idea.  Don\'t try to do all three together, and certainly don\'t interrupt yourself with email or IRC or Twitter or Quora.  ;)  Get your mind set to do one thing, then do that thing for a good block of time before you switch to doing something else.
#     Prioritize.  This is the area where I constantly see people fail.  Every problem worth tackling has many facets.  Often, solving one part of the problem will make solving the others easier.  Therefore, getting the order right really matters.  I\'m afraid there\'s no simple answer for how to recognize that order, but as you gain more experience within a problem domain - practice again - you\'ll develop a set of heuristics that will guide you.
#     Reuse everything.  Reuse ideas.  Reuse code.  Every time you turn a new problem into a problem you already know how to solve - and computing is full of such opportunities - you can save time.  Don\'t worry if the transformed solution isn\'t absolutely perfect for the current problem.  You can refine later if you really need to, and most often you\'ll find that you\'re better off moving on to the next problem.
#     A lot of these really come down to efficiency.  As you move through more problems per day, you\'ll gain more experience per day, which will let you move through more problems per day, and so on.  It\'s a feedback loop; once you get on its good side, your effectiveness (and value) will increase drastically.")

# a21 = Answer.create(body: "I had a strange encounter with some guys while I was in Laos (the country between Thailand and Vietnam) and with Chinese nationals in Yunnan who thought similarly.
# - Pretty much everyone has white skin, or are as pale as possible.
# This simply stems from the Bai, Li, and Hmong affinity for pale skin as a sign of obvious wealth and luxury. America is the wealthiest country on earth, thus everyone must take pains to look wealthy by keeping their skin white. It was very hard to explain tanning to them.
# - Everyone is filthy rich and the doctor son of a doctor.
# Stories will trickle back from relatives who moved a long time ago, mostly the perception of the suburbs and how clean they are and the cars that everyone drives. Also, Modern Family and Big Bang Theory somehow made their way there, confirming any suspicions. Inevitably, America becomes a swarming sea of suburbia for all the doctors and lawyers and businessmen that make up our population, nobody has to farm or work, and everything is pretty awesome for those who make it. Unfortunately, this leads to the next one.
# - Americans don't know how to do work.
# I suppose this is true for a number of teenagers and children these days, not to mention young adults, some baby boomers... well, truthfully a lot of people can't lift a hammer. The explanations of how to use a digging hoe were extensive, and if we were slow, we'd need to be shown a demonstration. Blisters earned you some laughs from callus-handed kids.
# - We largely don't kill animals.
# This surprised me, since we obviously do, but the explanation turns out to come from NGOs and other servicemen, who would often be vegetarian or express a refusal to kill or harm living livestock for food. Girls in my group told a man not to kill a snake, and he gave them a quizzical look before pounding it to smithereens with a shovel. In rural areas, the Americans they saw were very much not in the mood to see blood.
#   - The \"hamburger\" is the primary source of sustenance for Americans.
#   Not having access to ham, or not aware that it's actually the relatively rare meat \"beef,\" most restaurants would serve Laotian hamburgers made completely vegetarian (see above) with two pieces of toast, cabbage, onion, and a slice of tomato. I also saw this in Dali Prefecture, China. They usually managed to get fries right though.
#   - Anything that starts with \"American\" is state-run.
#   This was always a problem for some reason. For instance, I go to American University and shop at American Eagle. After nodding and some weird responses, turns out the impression was that I was a state worker and that my clothes were made by government companies.
#   - America is black and white.
#   In Laos, they were surprised by my friend who is Korean-American. They repeatedly attempted to speak Chinese to him, and when we explained we only spoke English, they couldn't believe that he was from Illinois. In China, they weren't as unaware, but they did have an insulting word for him.
#   - We're all very religious.
#   Both of our guides in Laos and China told me that they were always surprised by how much we gave tribute to shrines. I always bow to the Buddha before entering a temple out of respect, and after a while my guide asked \"So, you are very Buddhist?\" He then told me that a lot of tourists did the same and he found it strange, since many of his friends were atheist or Christian.
#   - The alcohol age is much lower.
#   Like, 10 years lower.
#   - Justin Bieber is American.
#   This is just an insult.")

#
# Keep separate bank accounts. When we share an expense, like the rent, we both contribute. Some people are astounded (even offended) that we do this, but in 18 years of being together, we've yet to have a single fight over money.
#   Play together. We play traditional games, like chess, but more often we talk in silly voices, use socks as puppets, etc. We have a pantheon of characters that \"live with us.\"
#   Keep in touch throughout the day. While at work, every couple of hours, we check in via email, phone or IM.
#   Spend a lot of our alone time together. We both love sitting on the sofa, doing our own thing. My wife may watch TV while I post answers on Quora, or she may do a crossword puzzle while I read. It's nice to be in the same room together without any expectation that one of us has to amuse the other.
#     Work on projects together. We run a theatre company, in which she acts and I direct. So our major hobby time is spent together, building stuff together. We do the same with home improvements, cooking, etc.

# q12 = Question.create(title: "What are some of the best moments of humanity?", description: "")
# a24 = Answer.create(body: "There was this British game show called the Golden Balls. The final round of this game was called Split or Steal. The rules of the game were:
#
# After five balls have been won, the contestants make one last decision to determine the final jackpot division. Each contestant chooses one of two final golden balls, one with \"Split\" printed on the cash background inside it, and one with \"Steal\" printed on the killer background inside it.
# If both contestants choose a Split ball, the jackpot is split equally between them and they both go home with half the money they've won.
# If one contestant chooses a Split ball and the other chooses a Steal ball, the Stealer goes home with all the money and the Splitter goes home empty-handed.
# If both contestants choose Steal balls, they both go home empty-handed.
#
# Enter Nick Corrigan. This man had a brilliant idea that would ensure that he would win. He is the guy on the right. Now the players have a chance to speak with each other face to face before making their choices. People would make promises about choosing split and renege and choose steal often resulting in neither player winning the amount. His opponent was Ibrahim Hussein. Nick promises he would steal and split the money with Ibrahim if he chose split. Everyone was flabbergasted by Nick's strategy. Ibrahim tried to convince him to choose split. Ibrahim even gave him his word that he would choose split, and to emphasize what keeping his word meant to him, told him a story about how his father had told him that a man who did not keep his word was not a man. The audience booed him, Ibrahim called him names, but Nick did not budge. After 45 minutes of conversation Ibrahim finally gave up and agreed to choose split because he knew it was going to be a lost cause anyway and hoping that Nick would keep his word after he won the money. Then they were asked to show the ball they had chosen and as expected Ibrahim has chosen split, but Nick had chosen split too. Everybody was shocked. Both of them won half the prize amount.
#
# This is where the story ends in the video. Radiolab did an episode on the same where they discussed with the participants about what had happened[1]. Turns out Ibrahim never wanted to split the money. He wanted to pick steal and take the entire amount for himself. The story about his father was a fake one. He had never met his father. He was brought up by his mother. The line that he spoke was stolen from a film. He did not want to be a sucker, so he would have picked steal irrespective of what the other person said. Nick manipulated this guy to be good. Now the wonderful thing about Nick is that he runs a not for profit organization and all his winnings went into that. So he was actually not playing for himself as much as playing for a charity and in the process he restored our faith in humanity.

# a25 = Answer.create(body: "This won't be a popular answer, but if you are talking about technology startups in Silicon Valley, then the answer is yes, you probably are hurting your chances.
# Silicon Valley has a peculiar and yet virulent bias against the suit.  It's even a euphemism for an overly-conservative, corporate-buzzword-speaking, pointy-haired-Dilbert-boss.  No one wants to work with an \"empty suit\".  Software engineers help strongly define the culture in Silicon Valley, and they overwhelmingly don't wear suits, or in general they don't want to work with people who do.
#
# There are exceptions (Siebel was a notable example of a culture that emphasized the suit).  But you will even find a large companies, unless you are interviewing for a position in sales & finance, that you will hurt your chances in a suit.
#
# For younger people looking for jobs in small to mid-size hyper-growth companies a suit has also come to imply a lack of prioritization.  You spend too much time on your clothing, which will not impact business success, and too much time on appearances.
#
# Startups are notoriously contrarian cultures, they are looking to change the status quo.  Dressing in a suit represents the status quo, or at least, a caricature of it.  (This, of course, leads to an ironic conformity in how people at startups dress.)
#
# There is also a strong signal of lack of confidence wearing a suit.  The implication is that you wear a suit because your skills are not strong enough on their own to justify your employment.  You might find that engineers, in general, are proud of the fact that their skills are so valuable that they can find gainful employment where they don't have to wear a costume.  A suit reminds people of what young high school or college students might do to appear grown up.
#
# Probably the most damning thing about the suit in this context, however, is the appearance of being tone deaf or difficult.  You know (as does everyone) that no one wears a suit at a tech startup.  But you wore one anyway.  Either you don't realize that this isn't acceptable, or you are some form of suit-activist.  Neither sounds that appealing in a new hire.

# a44 = Answer.create(body: "Many years ago I was evaluating the service on a flight between Bahrain and LHR. The flight was full and the crew included one junior whose first working flight had been the LHR-BAH sector. She had done a good job on the first sector and had been complimented by her fellow crew-members.  But what was most noticeable was the fact she appeared to be rather shy.
# Boarding for the return flight went fine. There was a relatively small mix of male passengers who were wearing their national attire; a thobe, (an ankle-length robe-type garment, with long sleeves.), and ghutra, (a traditional headdress).
#
# It was a relatively easy flight. It wasn't full and it afforded me time to offer service tips and observe.
#
# But we weren't an hour into the flight that the young junior rushed into the back galley in tears. She was sobbing. After calming her she finally blurted out that the man in 36K (indicating a window seat in the back of the aircraft), had lifted his thobe,  exposing himself to her.
#
# After years of flying your first thought is 'oh no, not another one of these pathetic fruitcakes,' but your professional side prevails, whilst you deal with calming the new crew member and then needing to address the offensive and illegal act committed by the passenger.
#
# I, along with two female crew members calmed the girl. I recall one of the more senior crew members 'welcomed' the junior into her initiation and assured her that she'd be seeing much worse in the years to come.
#
# And now I had the task of dealing with the passenger. There was no one sitting next to him, nor was there anyone in the last row of seats behind him. \"Sir,\" I began, \"I understand you have exposed yourself to one of our crew members.\" I paused a second, waiting for the inevitable denial to come from the passenger. But his response was a surprise. \"She likes these things, doesn\'t she?\" he asked, with an utterly creepy look on his face.
#
# I was now stern. My response was prompt and succinct. \"No, she doesn\'t and neither would anyone else. And, Sir, if we have any reports of this happening again, we will have the legal authorities come on board to deal with your behaviour.\"
#
# I felt I had said enough. He had his warning and I hoped that would be the end of it. I was consciously ready to now go back to the galley and tell the young crew member that she should work the other side of the aircraft and simply forget about the matter.
#
# But my stern admonishment prompted a response from the recalcitrant passenger I hadn\'t anticipated. He fixed his gaze on me and said \"Maybe you want to see too?\" And he then lifted his thobe to reveal the fact that he had nothing underneath.
#
# Strategy. I remember that I actually sighed as I walked away from the passenger. I said nothing. I knew I needed to form a prompt and effective strategy to deal with this. We had another six hours of flight ahead of us.
# Of course, I would be informing the Captain of what occurred. Ultimately, it would be his decision to have the passenger handed over to police upon our arrival. But I knew we needed a bit more for the moment.
#
# The BA flights have a good balance of male and female crew members. But it was clear this passenger's aberrant behaviour could be perpetrated upon passengers. And I took note there were some children on board.
#
# I asked one of the male crew members to move up the aisle, only on the starboard (left) side of the aircraft, from row 34, forward and inform the passengers that due to a technical issue we it had been necessary to lock the aft lavatories and would they be so kind as to use the lavatories in the centre of the aircraft.
#
# I then asked one of the CSM's (one of the team leaders), to assist me in my plan. I'd flown with her in the past and not only did she have a lovely sense of humour, she was excellent in diffusing awkward situations. I quickly filled her in on my strategy.
#
# We moved down the aisle to where the lone passenger was. I made certain he was looking at us when I gesticulated to the man by pointing to him and then holding up my hand and lifting my 'pinkie' finger, wiggling it to signify the diminutive and homuncular nature of ...er, um...something.  My colleague then looked at the man, then looked back at me and giggled, also holding up her hand and wiggling her pinkie finger, so as to acknowledge that I was suggesting something involving the passenger was nanoscopic.
#
# Neither of us looked directly at the passenger again, we just sniggered to ourselves and moved on. I then brought another crew member up the aisle just as if I were heading towards the front of the aircraft. But the other crew member turned to look at the passenger and gave a little chuckle.
#
# I deliberately came back to the aft cabin by way of the port side aisle. But I could notice out of the corner of my eye that the passenger appeared to be 'stewing' (for lack of any other way to describe it).
#
# And I later learned that during the meal service, the male crew who covered the starboard side of the aircraft, one of the two men deliberately leaned over to the passenger and asked him if he'd like a 'tiny little breadstick?'
# It seems the point had been driven home. We had no more problems with the man during the flight. And true to our word, two police officers were at the gate on arrival. They came on board before we disembarked the passengers and went to the back of the aircraft to welcome him to the United Kingdom.
#
# The police disembarked this passenger via the galley door.

# Working across the world, we can come across a vast range of cultural differences. It doesn't mean one is better than another. However, a common thread of respect is paramount for all. In the absence of this we can only collapse into anarchy. ")

The plane had just left the runway when there was an explosion that shook the plane, followed a moment later by a second explosion. The plane then proceeded to fly normally up to cruising altitude, when the pilot came on the intercom, blisteringly angry.
#
# When we were taking off, two military jets were scrambled, and they took off on the same runway we were on. Using afterburners, one went over the left wing, followed by the other going over the right wing. The pilot gave us a couple of minutes to get out pen and paper, and then proceeded to give us detailed instructions on where we should send our complaints.")
# q21 = Question.create(title: "What are the different ways to kill time in prison?", description: "")
# a46 = Answer.create(body: "I spend some time calling my family and friends from a cellphone I had in my room... and no, I didn't smuggle it - I was allowed to have a cellphone 24/7 in my room. Sounds weird? Read on.
#
# Some years ago I was sentenced to 16 months in prison.
# I served the time at three different places, first in a closed prison (2 months), later in an open prison (6 months) and the last part in a halfway-home (3 months) - so I effectively served 11 months ~ two-thirds of the total sentence. It is common practice to be released on parole after two-thirds of a sentence is served.
#
# I'll refer to \"closed prison\" and \"open prison\" as just CP and OP respectively.
#
# Prisons here - in Denmark - are nothing like what you normally think of as a prison, so I will probably have to explain quite a lot along the way so you'll understand why I was able to spend time as I did.
#
# You can wear your own clothes both in CP and OP. You're allowed to bring a \"reasonable amount of clothes.\"
# I usually wore button-up collared shirts and quite a few of my inmates thought it was weird, but well, that is how I dress normally and I feel comfortable like that.
# A room contains: couch/bed, closet for your clothes, TV with DVD player and cable, refrigerator, sink, chair, table and notice board for your pictures.
#
# You're given a key to your room that will open the lock just above the handle - the lock seen further up can only be accessed from the outside and only the guards have the key for that.
#
# During nighttime you are locked up in your own room, that is typically from 21:30 till 7:00 in the morning.
#
# During daytime you can go to your own room and lock the door for some privacy, go to another inmate's room if he allows you to, spend time in the common room with other inmates or go to the kitchen and cook some food.
# The above applies to both CP and OP.
#
# Work... In both CP and OP you're required to work for some hours each day, weekends excluded.
# In CP you start every day by cleaning the common room, kitchen, toilets etc. from 8:00 till 8:30. After that we spend the time putting plastic pieces in cardboard boxes, but most days there weren't that much work so we were usually done after 3-4 hours or so, which means the rest of the day is free to spend as you like (or well, within the limits of course...)
# The work at CP was done by all inmates in the common room. That's 10 people in a section.
#
# In OP the cleaning is taken care of by one selected inmate, who is responsible for cleaning and tasks such as refilling toilet paper. That usually took 3 hours after which the person could spend time in his own room. Everyone else went off at 8:30 to the greenhouse located within the prison. There we did anything you can imagine you do in a greenhouse - such as feeding pots into a machine that fills them with soil, put the pots onto rolling tables, taking these into the greenhouse, putting the trays onto grow beds, adding seeds, watering, cutting plants, packaging for sale, getting rid of old empty pots, cleaning grow beds, adding stuff to the soil mixer etc.
# We were allowed to carry a utility knife at work for opening soil packaging, cardboard boxes etc.
# We had to leave the knife at work before returning to the living quarters, though it sometimes happened that people forgot to do that in which case you just handed the knife to the guards explaining that you forgot to leave it at work.
#
# Going for a walk in the prison yard... In CP you cannot leave the building that you're in, except two times a day for 30 minutes where you could walk around on a limited space accompanied by one or two guards - that is one or two guards and anywhere between 5 and 10 prisoners or so. If you wanted out for those 2x30 minutes you had to put your name on a whiteboard no later than one hour before scheduled time for the walk.
#
# In OP it was quite different. There are no walls or fence surrounding the place, so you can actually walk away from the place and grab the bus to the nearest city. There had been cases of people leaving, especially during working hours as the public road was about 5 meters from where we dumped off used soil for processing. That road can be seen in the picture below (curvy road top-right corner). However if you left OP you would likely end up in CP afterwards. That's the principle. You can walk away, nothing really prevents you from doing so, but you know you'll just end up with worse conditions... so... well...
# Economy... In both CP and OP you get a fixed amount of money every week for buying food and on top of that you're paid for working.
# The fixed amount that you get for food is roughly 70 USD per week.
# Work paid roughly 1 dollar 50 cent per hour, so that added up to roughly 50 USD per week.
# If you made sure you were ready for work in time and did a decent job you would be given an additional 45 cent per hour (17 USD per week)
# If you did the same work for 3 months you were normally given an additional 45 cent per hour (or 17 USD per week), so the maximum hourly wage is roughly 2 dollars 40 cents.
# People who had previous experience with the same sort of job, eg. working in a greenhouse in real life, would be given the additional 45 cents from day one.
# So total pay per week could be anywhere between 70 USD (for someone not working at all) to 154 USD per week.
#
# You had to pay for certain things that were automatically deducted from your weekly pay. Those things were cable/pay-channels (6 USD), soap for the washing machine (1 USD), rent of TV set with DVD player (4 USD) and rent of cellphone (90 cents) - yes, cellphone...
#
# The cellphone was only available in OP, you had it in your own room and it was attached to the wall by wire so you couldn't (or at least weren't supposed to) take it outside of the room.
# You put in your own SIM-card and could use the phone whenever you were allowed to be in your room, which would normally be at any time except during work. So I could call whoever I wanted in the evening and say hi, or send my girlfriend (not the girlfriend that made me end up in prison) a text message. Nobody listened in on the calls, it was a perfectly normal Nokia cellphone, but an old version without camera, sound recording capabilities or support for MMS - as those things would be illegal to possess in a prison.
#
# In CP there was no cellphone in the room. Instead there was a payphone in the common room from which you could call up to 10 different numbers that had to be approved first - so I obviously had my parents, grandmother, close friends and last but not least my girlfriend as numbers I could call.
# They could listen in on the calls though I don't know to which extent they actually did that.
#
# Library... In CP there was a library with quite a decent selection of books, magazines and CD's that we could borrow. I was delighted to find Kings of Leon - Only by the Night as part of the selection. We could go there once a week.
# In OP it was different. Once a week we could sign up for a trip to the local public library since there was no library at the prison itself. We were driven there in an 8 person mini-bus by one guard.
#
# Shopping and cooking... In most prisons you're not served food, instead you have to cook your own food.
#
# In CP there was a small grocery store within the prison where we would go twice a week. You could buy different kinds of meat, vegetables, ice cream, soft drinks, pasta, shaving foam, cigarettes and tobacco, shampoo, toothpaste, sugar, etc.
# We had access to a kitchen with the necessary equipment - though the larger knives were attached by wire to the wall.
# Since quite a few of my fellow inmates had little clue about cooking I ended up making dinner for 4-5 people almost every evening during the two months I spend in the closed prison. That was great for me since I really enjoy being in a kitchen, so I was happy to spend a few hours there every day.
# I wrote shopping lists for everyone in the group so each person bought different ingredients and paid their share.
#
# In OP there was no grocery store, so twice a week we would go to the local grocery store to buy stuff. We were allowed to buy almost anything, with exception of alcohol. This was a nice change since the grocery store had a much better selection of goods and better prices than the one in CP.
# We would walk around the store like everyone else, grabbing our stuff off the shelf. We were usually 7 inmates and one guard going in a mini-bus to the grocery store.
#
# Barbecue in the summer is a nice thing and we could actually do that in OP.
# We could buy charcoal at the grocery store and some good steaks. Until sunset the doors to the outside were not closed in OP, so we could go outside and do some activities in the garden. Some played soccer while I often enjoyed lying on the lawn in the sun listening to music on my headphones - I was allowed to bring an old-school Discman in the OP.
#
# Playing board games was a good way to pass time, especially in CP.
# We would often sit 3-4 people in the common room playing cards or some board game for hours... and drinking coffee!
# When we fancied a cigarette we would have to go to our own room, or a room of someone who allowed smoking.
#
# PlayStation 2 was another way of spending time in OP.
# In OP you could bring a PlayStation 2 (not PS3 since it has Wi-Fi) and play games. One dude had a wheel and paddles and enjoyed playing Gran Turismo quite a lot of the time. I didn't bring one myself so I sometimes spend time at another inmates room playing on his PS2.
#
# Both in CP and OP you could bring up to 30 DVDs or CDs, so everyone was borrowing DVDs and CDs from each other.
#
# I brought along a selection of my favorite movies and must-have CDs for those lonely hours.
#
# Watching TV was probably the most common thing to do to pass time. At both CP and OP there was a decent selection of channels including Discovery, National Geographic,  EuroSport etc.
#
# Going to church was another option both at CP and OP.
# In OP I never went to church since I didn't really see the point of doing so, I'd rather do something else since I don't consider myself belonging to any religion. However in CP where we spend a lot of time inside the same building I went to church a few times for the free coffee and pastry, and just to see something else than the same building from the inside.
# Sadly one guy from the section decided to buy hashish at the church from another inmate and was caught doing so. Since that happened rules were changed and everyone attending church would afterwards have to strip naked, something I didn't fancy doing for some coffee and pastry.
#
# Surfing the internet for a while was great! At OP we could use a computer for 1 hour a few days a week. We weren't allowed to view pornographic material, do anything else illegal or suspicious such as searching for explosives etc., but apart from that we could surf the net as we wanted - including sending e-mails.
# However all traffic and all keystrokes were logged and a guard had to be present in the room.
#
# Learning HTML/CSS for 5 days was the result of an idea I got one afternoon.
# I used to teach HTML/CSS some years ago, so I went to the social worker at the OP and presented the idea of me teaching the other inmates HTML/CSS. Clearly the whole idea of an inmate teaching anyone anything was quite new, but she liked the idea and it finally was made possible. So for 5 days six of my fellow inmates spend their time learning HTML/CSS rather than going to the greenhouse - so we all received our standard pay just as if we had spend the time filling soil into pots. Win!
#
# Playing League of Legends with my friends all night long was another activity I enjoyed a lot in OP. However I wasn't allowed to do that but...
# One of the first things I did in prison was to acquire a copy of the book containing the law on prisons, prisoner rights etc..
# I read it thoroughly and therefore I was more knowledgeable on the rules than the vast majority of people employed at the prison. I wanted to know my rights and I knew them well. Other inmates often consulted me with regards to rules etc., or whenever they felt they had been treated unfair.
# So from reading this I had figured that if I started on some kind of education I could be allowed to bring my own laptop in my room so I could use it to study. I signed up for some stuff and just as I had assumed I was allowed to bring my laptop.
# Studying had another benefit. I was allowed to stay at my room for roughly 12 hours a week in order to study, while everyone else went to the greenhouse to work. Since those hours were always in the morning I decided that the time was better spend by taking a nap - so I did... and I never actually did any studying, but I did well at pretending to do so. I was still receiving my normal hourly pay for those hours spend on slee... eh.. studying.
# The security in an OP is very low, so I brought a 3G USB modem and put it in a pack of tobacco during the day.
# We were locked up in our own room from 21:30 and 30 minutes or so after that, when the guards had left the section for the night, I hooked up the modem to the laptop and played online with my friends on the outside - usually until early morning.
#
# Visitors are allowed in both in CP and OP.
# In CP you could have visitors on certain weekdays. People who would like to visit you would have to fill out a form and send it to the prison in advance in order to be approved for visit. When approved people could call the prison and ask for a time. I would then be given a piece of paper with the time and date, and names of those coming to visit.
# I was lucky that lots of people came to visit me, including my girlfriend, parents, grandparents and a few close friends so on average I had visitors 2 to 3 times a week.
# Visits were either 1½ hours or 3 hours depending in the distance the visitor had traveled in order to get there so that people coming from far away would get more time.
# I had to leave the living quarters and walk to the visitors department.
# Visits take place in a private room with a lock on the door that can be locked from the inside. So I always looked forward to my girlfriend coming by.......
# After each visit I would have to strip naked before returning to the living quarters. Any gifts received from visitors would have to be handed over to guards and pass through a check, they could then be collected the day after.
# Spending time with people you love is great, especially when that time is limited. Definitely the best way to spend time in prison.
#
# In OP visitors could come during weekends between 10:00 and 17:00 and stay for the entire day if they liked.
# Visitors were allowed in the living quarters (such as the common room and kitchen), in your own room and in the garden, so it all took place in the same surroundings that you were in every day and you could invite visitors to your own room - sweet!
#
# Leaving on weekends isn't exactly time spent in prison, but it still counts as time served.
# In OP you are allowed to leave the prison every 3rd weekend (Friday afternoon till Sunday evening) and spend the weekend at your parents or girlfriends place. This will of course depend on the sentence and circumstances, and whether or not you take drugs in prison, since that could get you caught in an urine sample test in which case you're not allowed to leave for usually two months.
# So every third Friday I would leave the prison and use public transportation to get home. You had to pay a fixed amount of roughly 8 USD for the ticket, anything more than that was paid by the prison.
#
# Your imagination is another way of spending time in prison. I used to spend hours everyday just daydreaming, it's really motivating in a much needed way.
#
# I'm not complaining cause in many ways it wasn't too bad being in prison. I remember some nights in prison I was watching a series on National Geographic showing how it is to be an inmate at San Quentin - woah...
# My thoughts are with the people serving their time under such inhumane conditions.
# It is my hope that more people around the globe will realize that it is possible to imprison people in more humane ways than it is currently the case in many places, such as the US.

# a47 = Answer.create(body: "Considering I'm incarcerated for murder, maybe 'kill' is not the best choice of words. However, here is my list of 10 ways to pass time in prison.

# #10 Sleep - During extended lock downs and prolonged periods of cell-time, nothing beats a good nap.
#
#
# #9 Write Letters - There is no internet or cellphones in prison. Snail Mail is the standard for outside communication.

# q22 = Question.create(title: "What laws do police officers least enjoy enforcing?", description: "")
# a48 = Answer.create(body: "There are two classes of the least enjoyed - the investigations that are undesirable because the crime is heinous, and the investigations that are undesirable because they're a pain in the neck.
#
# Items from the first class are pretty easy to guess:
# Child molestation/rape (yes, above homicide - always involves a true victim)
# Homicide / suicide
# Fatality DWI (all fatals are tragic, but not so senselessly tragic)
# Elder abuse
# Domestic violence
#
# As most of those are common sense, I would surmise that the question is chasing after the second class. Of those, each officer has his favorites and his peeves. A compendium of my least enjoyed enforcement: <rant>
# Leaving the Scene of an Accident. Just ganked that yield and crunched someone's car? If you stay, all kinds of benign to mild things can happen. First, the other person may not want to do anything - you might have had the good fortune of hitting someone with an active arrest warrant, who will forgo restitution for the car to keep themselves out of jail - it's happened more than once. Or they may just want to swap info. Worst case, I come, jot down some notes, and you get two municipal citations (here, Failure to Yield Right of Way and Striking a Lawfully Operating Motor Vehicle). It's like $150 after court costs. Sure, it sucks, but your driving sucks - it's car-ma.
#
#   Now let's review what happens when you leave. The other driver zeroes in on your license plate, rattles it off and repeats it verbally in a loop until they can write it down or text it to themselves. I arrive and get a Post-It note or a cell phone shoved in my face while the victim screams at me, bouncing up and down and furiously pointing in your last known direction of travel. I become instantly and fantastically pissed, because you just tripled my paperwork and added one or two hours to my workload. To put a cherry on that sludge sundae, I work the accident weathering merciless questions about what happens next, what happens next, what happens next, and denying solicitations of promises about finding you.
#
#   Oh, but I will find you, because my rage has taken your status from \"Vehicle #2\" to \"prey.\" I plug in the license plate, get your address, and go to your house. When I get there, I don't write you a ticket - that courtesy is through. Bai bai diplomacy, no more diplomacy - your diplomacy priv-il-eg-es are through. You are going to jail. You will not pass Go. You will not collect $200. I hated LSOAs.
#
#   Past Residential Burglary / Stealing From a Vehicle. So you left your door unlocked, huh? Somebody exploited that fact and jacked your stuff? That bites. Oh, you want me to write about it? Hmm...'Vic neglected to utilize sole security feature in residence/vehicle\'s point of ingress. Unknown subject accessed residence/vehicle and stole ___________. No further information.\' That should cover it. Oh, you swear to God you locked it? Well, unless the perpetrator is the resurrected Jesus Christ or Patrick Swayze circa 1990 (and that\'s completely unrealistic - you know, since that M.O. doesn\'t fit either of them), you\'re going to have to explain the lack of damage to the door with whatever manner of strained logic you wish. Come to think of it, though, it could have been Jesus - I happen to know he takes issue with your swearing to God (Matthew 5:34).
#
#   Oh, so your apartment got broken into and you refuse to allow me to investigate (true story, folks)? Bye, but as I\'m leaving, two tips: One, pay your dealer on time, and two, find an offsite location for your stash. I know, I wax prickish - there are true victims of these crimes. However, and I apologize, there is more often than not scant little I can do about it. Unless your car and house interiors are covered in glass, I\'m not going to get good prints. I know, I know - CSI gewgaws this, Cold Case techniques that. Listen, I\'ve got a glorified tackle box that contains a glorified foundation brush and carbon dust. Unless somebody died during the course of the burglary, that\'s literally it. It\'s all I\'ve got, it\'s all I have time for (95% of the time), and I\'m not calling a Major Crimes Investigator out because my lieutenant would chew my face off. I mean, I\'ll try, but please don\'t hold your breath here.
#
#   And when you replace the TV, for God\'s sake, write down the serial number. Seriously, it takes two seconds - and in a lot of cities, if they try to pawn your item, it\'ll get red flagged as stolen. Short of that, it\'s just another TV.

#   Petty Shoplifting, ESPECIALLY Juveniles. If a convicted felon is bebopping out of your store with $1,400 worth of clothes (happened), I am frickin\' ON THAT like dots on dice. However, if a fourteen year old girl palms a $1 bracelet with a kitty on it (also happened), I...sigh. Yes, I know it's CORPORATE POLICY to press charges. Here\'s what I also know. I can\'t cite a minor criminally, so I get to call the county juvenile office. They\'ll obviously tell me to release to a parent. I\'ll call parent, who was invariably 1) at work or 2) out of town. Either way, I get to sit there and stare at a fourteen year old girl who is either 1) violently sobbing or 2) completely nonplussed to the point of eye-rolling and disdainful sighs. After the nigh-unto-forever wait, I write a meaningless report that goes to the JO. They flag her school file for administrative probation. Justice!

Here\'s how that call response goes: I barrel down the street and open my window without slowing down. Unless I hear artillery shells going off, see a structure fire or see a column of hellfire scorching the atmosphere, I\'m back in service.
#

# a49 = Answer.create(body: "There could be a lot of different answers to this question, but the one that most immediately comes to mind are laws that cops are required or strongly encouraged to enforce rigorously, but that are treated casually by prosecutors. For example, when I worked in Nevada in the 1980s, possession of any identifiable amount of marijuana was a felony under Nevada law. If we found a roach (butt of a MJ cigarette) in a pocket or an ashtray, we had to make an arrest and process it as if we had found a kilo of pharmaceutical-grade cocaine. When the case got to the DA's office, it would nearly always be either dismissed outright or dealt down to some unrelated \"legal fiction\" offense (one where the facts of the case do not justify the charge, but the defendant agrees to plead guilty to the charge as part of a plea bargain) that was satisfied by a fine.
#
# In other jurisdictions, offenses like DUIs and domestic violence are often treated similarly. The police have virtually no discretion, but the prosecutors can dispose of those cases for political reasons or simply because they don't want to invest the time. Cases that justify a charge of grand theft under the law (usually defined by a loss threshold of $1000 or so--this varies with the jurisdiction) are prosecuted as petty theft until the loss reaches several times the statutory threshold.
#
# Legislatures are fond of enacting \"boutique\" statutes that benefit a small proportion of the population, but no one seriously expects will be enforced or prosecuted. Don't have a law unless you intend to enforce it at both the police and prosecutorial level. Perhaps it would be best to have a \'sunset\" date for criminal laws not addressed in common law, so that the boutique laws would automatically expire unless re-enacted.")
# q23 = Question.create(title: "What are the best things you learned in your first job?", description: "")
# a50 = Answer.create(body: "Some thoughts:
#
# You can't avoid office politics - Doesn't matter if you are a janitor or a CEO of your own business: There are always office politics.
# You'll never have a job which you \"can\'t quit\" - If you are being mistreated,exploited or under-appreciated...LEAVE. You\'ll eventually find another job (although it may not be a better one).
# You learn by listening, not talking - You\'ll learn by listening rather than talking in almost every job.
# ALWAYS look for another job - You wouldn't load your weapon as soon as you see an animal while you are hunting; you\'d do it before you go into the woods. Why wait until you need to look for a job, to look for a job?
#   Don't tell your co-workers about your personal business - Unless you want (or need) your personal affairs to become fodder for office gossip, leave them off of your job.
#   If you are genuinely sick - DON\’T COME TO WORK - Regardless of whatever you hear, stay home and get well. Your co-workers don\'t want to (or need to) get your illness.
#   Always say \"Thank You\" and \"Please\" when it is appropriate to do so - Nobody likes rude or uncouth co-workers, and manners go a long way.
#     Think before you speak - If it doesn't sound \"good\" in your head, it will sound even worse from your mouth.
#     Avoid people with bad attitudes unless you need their help. - They\'ll just bring you down or make you cynical.
#     Remember that a job is an inanimate object - Never love it, because it will never love you. If you have to \"love\" something...love the work that you do; not where you do it.")
# a51 = Answer.create(body: "My first job was at a management consulting firm. Though I did not particularly enjoy these two years,I learned a lot of things that have been helpful as my career has progressed.
#
# Early on, attitude matters as much or more than actual output. No one likes working with an a**hole, even if they are good. Sure if you are extraordinary you can get away with it, but most of us aren't THAT good at any one thing. (say like Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, or Alex Rodriguez)
# Until you are the CEO, regardless of your job title or job description, your actual job is to make your boss/supervisor's life easier. The sooner you realize it's about them, and not you, the smoother things will be
# Take performance reviews with a grain of salt, they will never be perfectly accurate - as with all things, there is human bias and irrationality built into the system. You are not as good or as bad as whatever your review explicitly says. Use whatever you get as feedback, that you can process and choose whether or not you want to make those changes.
# Attention to detail matters a lot, so learn to be detail oriented, even if that's not your normal mode of operation. Because in groups of humans, it's all about building trust. Having checked everything twice, and being really on top of your game is the easiest way to built that trust over time with people you don't know that well.
# Be a net adder of energy to a room, not a net removed of energy. It almost always pays to be positive, even when disagreeing.
# No amount of money is worth being bored. If you aren't engaged with what you do, switch it up unless you have some family obligations you can't get out of.
# When you start off your work will mostly consist of 100% stuff you don't necessarily want to do. As you get more senior and earn more trust, you earn the right to take on work/jobs that have a higher % stuff you like doing/enjoy and a lower % stuff you don't like doing but have to do
#   Culture fit/match is a big deal, you can be a total stud in one setting and a total dud in another, even while acting exactly the same. Be honest to yourself in looking for a culture in which you would enjoy working - For those of you that are very anti doing thing's anyone else's way, start something yourself!
#   If you don't tell your coworkers or boss what you want, they have no way of knowing. By just accepting all status quo, you are implicitly saying you are ok with the way things are. But be respectful and thoughtful when you do it, not entitled or greedy.
#   You won't figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life from your first job. (some people do, but it's rare). Instead focus on A/B testing in your own life - try to absorb all the things you experience and figure out what you enjoy, what you don't enjoy, what type of people you like working with, etc. Use the first job to get exposed to as many variations as possible, so you can make better choices going forward.")

# q25 = Question.create(title: "Why doesn\'t the USA invade Canada?", description: "")
# a58 = Answer.create(body: "Contrary to what some wiseacres would have you believe, the USA doesn't just go invading places just to invade them. The USA and Canada have been on good terms since everyone got over the War of 1812, and the status quo of a huge amount of trade and a (relatively) open border seems to suit everyone pretty well.
#
# Out of curiosity, though, does Canada have oil?")

# a60 = Answer.create(body: "Speaking as a Brit, we'd like to do this. Specifically, we'd like to TRY.
#
# The reason being, when countries lose wars to America, the Yanks plough in huge amounts of money to rebuild their economies.
#
# Basically, our optimal strategy is to wait until the Presidency of George Bush III, fight the war mid-Atlantic, surrender, and then watch the cash roll in.")
# a61 = Answer.create(body: "Well, we're actually working on it.
#
# I live in America, and I'm British, as is my wife.
#
# A chap I work with is also British. Another one is Australian. A couple of my friends are British too.
#
# I've got my Canadian next door neighbor on-side. I also believe that chap I met in a cafe the other day who was called Bernard might have been from Britain too.
#
# Basically, the Commonwealth is currently in the process of taking the Colonies back. The invasion is happening one person at a time.
#
# GOD SAVE THE QUEEN!")
# a62 = Answer.create(body: "Believe it or not, the U.S. military has actually planned for this eventuality.  True, plans might be a little out of date, having been made in the 1920's and 1930's, but still.
#
# War Plan Red primarily is concerned with invading Canada, out of the belief that Britain would use it as a staging point to invade the U.S. It does not envision striking outside the Western Hemisphere, primarily because the British Empire would initially have the advantage in numbers; it calls for a mainly-defensive war, attempting to get the British to negotiate for peace by occupying Canada.
#
# The British themselves did not have a real plan to attack the U.S. They would likely have written Canada off as indefensible, while concentrating their efforts against the American fleet and American shipping, as well as some coastal bombardment, hoping to produce a stalemate that the Americans would quickly grow tired of and negotiate terms.
#
# The Canadians had a potential counterplan for this as well, Defence Scheme No. 1, which provided for attacks against the U.S. in three locations.")
